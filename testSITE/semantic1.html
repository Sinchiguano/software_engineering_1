A program will use at least two of the five basic programming elements.

    Inputs are instructions and data given to the computer.
    Outputs are the results of the inputs as returned by the computer.
    Arithmetic operations perform mathematical calculations on data.
    Conditional constructs determine if a result is true or false.
    Looping instructs the computer to move through a series of instructions until a condition is met.
