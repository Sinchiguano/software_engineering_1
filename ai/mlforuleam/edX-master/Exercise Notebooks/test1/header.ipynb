    "### 1. Important: Only modify the cells which instruct you to modify them - leave \"do not modify\" cells alone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The code which tests your responses assumes you have run the startup/read-only code exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Work through the notebook in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the steps depend on previous, so you'll want to move through the notebook in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. It is okay to use libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find some questions are fairly straightforward to answer using built-in library functions.  That's totally okay - part of the point of these exercises is to familiarize you with the commonly used functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Seek help if stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck, don't worry!  You can either review the videos/notebooks from this week, ask in the course forums, or look to the solutions for the correct answer.  BUT, be careful about looking to the solutions too quickly.  Struggling to get the right answer is an important part of the learning process."
